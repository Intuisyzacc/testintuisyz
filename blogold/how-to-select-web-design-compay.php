                                        web design company:</p>

                                        The first step is to find the goals and objectives of your company in developing
                                        the website by asking these questions:

                                        How do I want to brand my website?
                                        <br>
                                        Who is my target audience?
                                        <br>
                                        How much information should I include in the website ?
                                        <br>
                                        What is the timeline for my website development project?
                                        <br>
                                        What programming features do I need for my site?
                                        <br>
                                        What kind of returns do I expect from the site and how will I measure it?
                                        <br>
                                        Once you have set your company’s objectives and goals, it’s time to look for a
                                        web design company that will assist you to achieve them. When searching for a
                                        web design company, you must consider the following:
                                    </p>




                                    </p>

                                    <h3> Work Experience</h3>
                                    <p>



                                        The web design firm you select should have some history of developing and
                                        marketing websites. If the firm is well established and successful, they should
                                        be able to provide you a portfolio of their previous work. They should also
                                        provide you a list of testimonials and references.

                                        It is important to hire a web design company that has experience.

                                        Years in business prove that the web design company is successful and has a
                                        stable business. Customer portfolio shows their experience in handling wide
                                        spectrum of website projects and whether they can handle your work. Three
                                        important questions to ask are:
                                        <br>
                                        How many customers do they have?

                                        How long has the company been designing and developing websites?
                                        <br>
                                        Do they have sufficient resources to complete your project? Most important
                                        resource is people with the right skills in web design, content writing, graphic
                                        design, quality control, project management, IT Security etc. Apart from people,
                                        they need IT infrastructure required to complete the project.

                                        When selecting a web development company the services the company provides is
                                        very important. If you select a company you want to make sure that it offers a

                                        Price is usually a priority for each business owner – particularly if you’re
                                        simply beginning out. Finding out the balance between price and quality is often
                                        very tricky. Affordability is very important however bear in mind that often
                                        inexpensive means low quality particularly within the web development industry.
                                        That’s why it is important to require the price and compare it against the
                                        company’s work expertise, services and support.

                                        If you produce realistic web site objectives and goals and match those to the

                                    <p>





                                        Every business has one thing in common; they need “customers” to be successful.
                                        If you have found a web development company that has ample work experience and
                                        references, then chances are you have found a company that offers good support
                                        and services.

                                        One easy trick to find out if a company gives good service is to see whether
                                        they have repeated customers. Customers generally become addicted to good
                                        service provided, once they are happy with a vendor, they prefer not to leave
                                        them.

                                        After launch of your new website, a good company will maintain a healthy
                                        relationship with you. Depending on how involved you are with the maintenance
                                        and publishing of content, a good agency will assist you in your analytic
                                        reporting and ensure that your website is helping you reach your goals.

                                        How is the company treating their oldest customers ? Are their websites
                                        maintained well ? Do you see errors or issues in their websites ? If you do, you
                                        have found a web designer who is not much involved in maintenance.

                                    <h3> Digital Marketing Experience
                                    </h3>
                                    <p>




                                        A professional web design company is always aware of digital marketing and the
                                        changes taking place in the ranking of websites on search engines. If you don’t
                                        consider this before finding a web design company, you will end up having to pay
                                        a third party to optimize your site for search engines.

                                        Try to give your digital marketing and web designing to the same company if
                                        possible. When two teams are updating the same website, it is hard to fix
                                        accountability on one vendor.

                                        We know this should go without saying when choosing a creative company, but you
                                        would be surprised! Have a good look at the work they have produced. Ask
                                        yourself the questions… Are they versatile? Has the company proved that they are
                                        capable of working within brand guidelines and with different types of
                                        customers?

                                        You probably want to avoid using a company that has ‘a company style’ and all
                                        work they produce looks very similar, the designs / creativity needs to be right
                                        for you and your brand. All companies are different and should be marketing in
                                        different ways.

                                        The company needs to know the importance of content first. Whether they create
                                        the content or receive from a copywriter, they are building the framework that
                                        is housing your content. They need to understand how your users will interact
                                        with the content and how you specifically will manage the content in the future.
