                                        Branding has become a common term that is more often utilized in the creative
                                        industry. However, many people have gaps in their knowledge and understanding of
                                        what branding is and what it is not.<br><br>
                                        In simple terms, branding can be defined as the art of creating an identity for
                                        a product/service or a company. It is a whole package of distinct features such
                                        as logo, name, colors, symbol, letters, promotions, etc.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The process of branding primarily involves creating and establishing a brand
                                        name. A brand name is a specific name given to a product, service, or concept.
                                        <br><br>
                                        However, branding has more to do other than choosing a name, logo, and design
                                        elements.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Here are a few insights into the reasons for inaccurate ideas associated with
                                        branding.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <strong>● Branding is not the same as marketing & advertising</strong><br><br>
                                        While examining the competitor's marketing strategies, business owners might
                                        feel that the changes those players brought to the strategies are the only
                                        factors that power their brand and led to their success. Considering branding
                                        just as marketing is one of the most common mistakes people make.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In the shift to an increased number of digital marketing channels, most
                                        marketing functions don’t have qualified marketers who can understand the
                                        distinct concepts of marketing and brand management. There is a need for uphill
                                        marketers who specialize in brand strategy.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Branding is not a thing that is depicted in a tagline or an ad campaign. Such
                                        elements are only a visual identification of the brand, while branding is the
                                        personality of a business. It’s a powerful tool that makes people choose your
                                        product, even if they are provided with other alternatives of the same quality.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <strong>● Branding is not just providing a logo or a name</strong><br><br>
                                        Most people associate branding with a website, a tagline, a logo, or even a
                                        brochure. Consider an example of a company selling some specific products
                                        getting their name’s font style, color, or other elements changed. Many people
                                        misunderstand this process as ‘rebranding’, as design elements are slightly or
                                        heavily altered. Well, this can be considered as a part of the rebranding
                                        process, however, rebranding is not just confined to changing the design
                                        elements.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <strong>● Branding is an intangible asset</strong><br><br>
                                        In the real sense, a brand is something we cannot touch or see. It is an
                                        identity perceived by the people, which means the perceptions, thoughts, and
                                        feelings that a business firm creates in the minds of people about that
                                        business’s product, services, and the business itself.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Different people can have different perceptions. The process of branding can be
                                        simple as well as complex, it depends on various factors. However, it is certain
                                        that branding is a multilayered process that includes intangible results. These
                                        factors can make it difficult for people to understand what branding really is.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <strong>● The term ‘branding’ is often overused or misused</strong><br><br>
                                        As mentioned earlier, many businesses say they brand their business, but
                                        actually, in reality, they might be bringing changes to their marketing
                                        strategies. This can create misconceptions among the customers or the audience.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Such firms don’t recognize that branding is the total sum of everything that
                                        they do.
                                        For perfect branding strategies, a company must also need to convey what its
                                        goals are like, how they are different, and what they can contribute.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Many board members and directors of most companies come up through sales,
                                        finances, or human resources. Most of them lack brand expertise and are probably
                                        overconfident in this area of business.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <strong>● The importance of branding is miscommunicated</strong><br><br>
                                        Business owners are always concerned if branding adds any value to their
                                        business. This is mostly because they might have been misinformed or do not have
                                        proper knowledge of branding. <br><br>
                                        Many people may also assume that branding does not provide a quick return on
                                        investment, so it is not an essential strategy. They are forgetting the fact
                                        that a well-designed brand is a long-term asset that adds real value to a
                                        business.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <strong>● Branding strategies are communicated poorly</strong><br><br>
                                        Many consulting firms offer great branding strategies that help companies
                                        establish their position. However, there are still firms that view branding as a
                                        commodity and offer strategies that are difficult to understand or set
                                        unrealistic goals. In such cases, people will misunderstand that the process of
                                        branding is so complicated and inaccessible.
                                        <br><br>
                                        There is another misconception that branding is only suited for big companies.
                                        This is because some of the most popular and most talked about brands are large,
                                        renowned corporates. Actually, the reality is all about how well the companies
                                        use branding for their growth and development.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <strong>● Branding is totally or partially in the hands of your clients
                                        </strong><br><br>
                                        Business firms of all sizes might bring several changes to their websites,
                                        marketing strategies, and design elements with an expectation to give a new life
                                        to the brand. In reality, the business does not own the brands, the customers
                                        do.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Whatever promotional strategies are adopted, customers play as a major
                                        contributor that makes or breaks a brand. This is the reason why most popular
                                        brands survive for an infinitely long time even if their products go downhill
                                        for a short period. Those firms have already earned the trust of customers and
                                        dominated as powerful brands in the market. Brands get developed by everything,
                                        including every touch they make with their customers.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The world of branding is evolving day by day. No matter, what the size of the
                                        business is, branding is an essential strategy for business promotion. Companies
                                        shall not limit thinking to the power and potential of a brand.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Branding agencies can help companies establish their place in their industry in
                                        a way that they prefer to be perceived by the targets. This ensures further
                                        brand development and effective business promotions.
