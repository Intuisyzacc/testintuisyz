                                        marketing is often expanding. A vital component of the job of any social media
                                        manager is calculating the return on investment (ROI) from social media. You are
                                        able to explain the value you provide to the business, better evaluate the
                                        success of your job, and iteratively enhance your strategy's performance as you
                                        gain experience. Due to its importance in creating and enhancing your <b>social

                                        you in expanding your social budget and plan. Spending money on tactics that are
