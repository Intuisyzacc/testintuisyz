                                    <p>




                                        In the past, search engine marketing and social media marketing treated as two
                                        distinct and different kinds of marketing.But the truth is that they are more
                                        interconnected.

                                        While Google has not stated that social media directly affects its search
                                        algorithm yet, there is proof to suggest that it does. 50% of companies that are
                                        not succeeding with SEO are not integrating SMM.

                                        Aside from that, the advantages of SMM have been well documented. If you would
                                        like a solid overall approach to internet marketing, you will need a balance of
                                        SMO and SEO.

                                    <p>




                                        Integrate social sharing tools into your site.You must include direct web links
                                        to your social media channels from your site and from your social media profiles
                                        back to your site. Add social media sharing buttons to every blog posts. Links
                                        on social media are considered as higher-quality links because social media
                                        sites have a high web authority.</p>
                                    <h5>
                                        2. Consistency is Key to SMO</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Creating your social media profile is an easy task. Fill out the profile data
                                        100%. It creates a more professional experience for others in your network, so
                                        all the contact information in your website should be same as they are on your
                                        social media profiles.




                                    </p>
                                    <h5>
                                        3. Align SEO keywords and Social Media</h5>
                                    <p>



                                        Keywords play an important role in maximizing the exposure of your social media
                                        profiles. If you are not optimizing your profiles, you’re leaving money on the
                                        table for your competitors. If you can effectively use your keywords in your
                                        profile or page, it will help achieve better ranking in keyword searches on
                                        google.


                                    </p>
                                    <h5>
                                        4. Use Keywords in Your Posts



                                    </h5>
                                    <p>


                                        Keywords are very important for your website, content, blogs and ad-campaigns.
                                        Keywords also helps to keep the content relevant to the target audience.

                                    </p>
                                    <h5> 5. Be Social on Social Media</h5>
                                    <p>



                                        Social signals are very important for search engine optimization because search
                                        engines look at how often you are posting, how many people interact with you,
                                        and if there are social sharing elements available to visitors.


                                    </p>
                                    <h5> 6. Use Branded Cover Images</h5>
                                    <p>


                                        Cover image is the first thing a user sees when they visits your page, and you
                                        must give them the best impression. You should convey your brand messaging to
                                        your current and prospective followers by using this opportunity. To make sure
                                        that your cover image is formatted and displayed by using recommended size
                                        guides for each platform. Use professional images for cover pic that are
                                        memorable and relevant.

                                    </p>

                                    <h5> 7. Stay in Control
                                    </h5>
                                    <p>


                                        Always use a company controlled email address to create the brand social media
                                        accounts. Never use a personal e-mail address. Because you no longer have access
                                        to that account due to employee turnover, so you cannot optimize that account.
                                        If used properly, social media can become the greatest asset for improving the
                                        organic search result of the website..
