                                        The learning curve for Google Analytics is steep. Although it is the most widely

                                                You must add ecommerce events to your website or app or to your

                                                When you add events and someone visits your website or app, you
                                                will

                                                Universal Analytics employs a session-based tracking method,
                                                whereas GA4
                                                employs
                                                an event-based monitoring approach. This implies that GA4
                                                monitors
                                                individual
                                                website activities, whereas Universal Analytics aggregates them
                                                into
                                                sessions.
