                                    <p>Designing is all about giving life to content. It is a channel of communication;
                                        the creation of an experience that combines various visual & other elements in
                                        an aesthetic way to convey your messages to the audience. So, being a designer
                                        apparently means choosing and blending multiple elements to craft something so
                                        impressive that influences the perception of the audience.<br>

                                        But, what if a designer picks elements like colour, fonts, images and other
                                        graphics to create a design of his/her own personal preference or only by
                                        following the latest design trends in the market? This is where things can go
                                        wrong. Here, one of the most important things to be considered is ignored, the
                                        target audience!<br>

                                        The target audience can be an individual or a group for whom you tailor your
                                        designs. You’ve got to figure out who your target audiences are and put your
                                        efforts into designing for them.<br>

                                        Why design for a particular audience?<br>

                                        The impact of personalised marketing is so big that it brings the best results
                                        across multiple mediums and channels of marketing. Target audiences are the
                                        emperors you serve. You must understand them inside-out, or else the end results
                                        might not generate the positive outcome that you expect.<br>

                                        Whether it’s a web design, graphic design, design for social media or printed
                                        media, the result of your hard work and the incredible designs that you have
                                        made can be of no use if it doesn’t appeal to the audience who you have
                                        targeted. When you know your target audience, you can tailor the designs to
                                        their needs and make them understand why they should purchase your
                                        product/service.<br>

                                        Designing for the right audience is a good business practice that enhances your
                                        overall designing & strategy building skills. The designer can save time &
                                        resources, narrow down options in every design aspect such as colour, font
                                        style, images, shape, layout etc. & design exclusively for whoever he/she
                                        intends the designs to serve. Targeted design ads & landing pages bring in more
                                        clicks and customers. They are tools that increase the chances of attracting the
                                        right leads to your sales.<br>

                                        Here are a few ways to define your target audience and build designs that
                                        connect with them:<br>

                                        Find your target audience & examine their needs
                                    </p>

                                        <img src="images/Slide1.jpg" alt="Thumb">

                                    <p>
                                        Identifying your target audience is the first step to connecting with them
                                        through your designs. Right from selecting the colour scheme to the layout and
                                        structure, the choice of your target audience determines the design elements you
                                        are going to use. Here are a few insights into knowing your target audience:<br>

                                        Research the market: It is essential to do detailed research on the audience for
                                        whom you are promoting the designs. The result of your research determines what
                                        currently works for you. You’ll have to analyse and discover their demographics,
                                        their choices, what makes them choose you, what products/services they use
                                        etc.<br>

                                        Understanding the basic demographics: To get a clear understanding, dig deep
                                        into the demographics of the targets. Define the targets with broad demographics
                                        such as age, location, gender, marital status, income, education, profession
                                        etc., based on the markets your design will serve.<br>

                                        Analyse psychographics: Demographics can be useful only to a certain extent,
                                        you’ll still have to understand the psychographics of the audience.
                                        Psychographics is nothing other than psychological and cognitive attributes such
                                        as their lifestyle, values and choices. Make a study on their activities &
                                        interests, the platform of choice to view designs, hobbies, values, priorities,
                                        how they think and feel etc. You can extract information by conducting surveys
                                        and polls for your target audiences or you can even collect information from
                                        your existing customers who share similar attributes.</p>

                                    </p>

                                    <h5>Use Design thinking</h5>
                                    <p>


                                        Design thinking is an approach where engineers, innovators, designers or other
                                        contributors to an organisation spend time thinking from the user’s perspective
                                        and are willing to make changes until a problem is solved. For a website owner,
                                        this can mean designing a website that is easy to read, understand and navigate.
                                        Right from understanding the problem to finding the solution, it is a continuous
                                        process, which is full of experimentation, research and collaboration of people
                                        & their ideas to create user-centric designs. The designs you make should be
                                        delightful enough to surprise the audience. If your designs are for a website,
                                        doing so can make them repeat visitors. If you understand their emotions and
                                        work according to that, you are more likely to turn visitors into customers. For
                                        design thinking to work well, you’ll have to put aside personal interests and
                                        then define personas for the target audience, which are discussed below in
                                        detail.

                                    </p>

                                        A buyer persona provides a detailed description of the buyer/target audience. It
                                        is a research-based profile that describes their goals, desires, challenges etc.
                                        Creating personas for each type of user is important to make a connection with
                                        the targets. Based on their profiles, think about what the buyers will be
                                        looking for when they land on your designs. Make an analysis of where they’ll
                                        find you, how they are going to find you and what action you want them to take.
                                        Whether it’s lead generation, promoting your brand or making a sale, you should
                                        have a clear picture of your marketing goals, why you are creating the designs
                                        and what are the requirements of the buyers.

                                    <p>



                                        While designing for a website or for other areas, it is essential to put aside
                                        personal preferences in favour of what works the best for the customers. It
                                        cannot be said that personal preferences are always wrong, or will never work,
                                        but acting according to your personal preferences alone can be a wrong choice.
                                        You’ll be required to strike a balance between personal choices and what the
                                        audience will appreciate. What appeals to use may be less enthusiastic to the
                                        audience. So, it’s the responsibility of the designer to put themselves in the
                                        shoes of the client and stay focused on the user’s perspective to produce
                                        designs that will be a perfect fit for the target audience.<br>Leverage design

                                        The graphic elements you use in the design should align with the demographics
                                        and psychographics of the audience. If you want to create impeccable designs
                                        that perfectly aim at a specific audience, here are a few tips and suggestions
                                        that can be used as guidelines:<br>

                                        Colour: Colour is an important element of every design. There is a theory of
                                        colour psychology, which almost all designers use to evoke reactions and
                                        emotions from the audience. The theory is based on emotions, which can be
                                        experimented with in your designs, however, that is not the only process. For
                                        trendier folks, crazy colours can be attractive, but for an elderly audience,
                                        something simple like the pastel should work. Colours are interpreted
                                        differently by every industry, gender, age group etc. You should reach a good
                                        conclusion from your research. The ultimate goal is to get the people to
                                        move.<br>

                                        Typography & Font: Typography and font are other important elements that express
                                        brand identity. Use typographical elements according to the demographics. For
                                        example, kids usually love funky and cartoony fonts, while designs for a
                                        corporate website usually showcase a kind of serif font. Likewise, font size is
                                        another important factor that requires consideration while making designs.<br>

                                        Content & style of writing: The interest of audiences can be influenced by
                                        content and style of writing. The tone and language to be used in the design can
                                        vary according to the audience. For example, a friendly tone is perfect for
                                        health & lifestyle based designs, while something conservative would work for
                                        the designs intended for an insurance company. In the same way, choose images,
                                        graphics, animations and other media that are relevant or that will arouse
                                        curiosity among the viewers.

                                        Design style & Layout: There is a wide range of design styles like vintage,
                                        artistic, contemporary, minimalist, traditional etc. to choose from. You can
                                        explore them and conduct a little bit of experimentation to understand what will
                                        be a perfect choice.

                                        Keeping up with the latest trends is a great way to stay focused on your target
                                        audience.
                                        <br>
                                        Optimise design for all screens: If your designs are for online media, then you
                                        will have to consider the devices used by the audience. The design elements need
                                        to be optimised for different screens such as smartphones, tablets, laptops
                                        etc.<br>

                                        Order your information hierarchically
                                        <br>
                                        Visual hierarchy is an important aspect of all designs. It just gives an order
                                        of importance, how the visual elements are positioned and displayed. Arranging
                                        your information in order by surfacing what’s more important and filtering out
                                        less important elements will make an effective piece of design. As a designer,
                                        you’ll have to figure out what the audience looks for the most when they see a
                                        design, so that you can make the important features brighter, bigger, bolder and
                                        catchy while leaving the second important things smaller or below the eye level.
                                        These are just basics to ensure that whoever sees the design gets the main
                                        points or the information that they expect.<br>

                                        Test your designs<br>

                                        You need to ensure that your designs are fit for the target audience. Test your
                                        designs to see if your message is really and easily understandable. For that,
                                        you can use different approaches like beta testing, a/b testing (comparing two
                                        versions of something to find out which is better) or testing your designs with
                                        colleagues and peers. After testing is completed, analyse the results and make
                                        adjustments as per test results.<br>

                                        Examine your competitors<br>

                                        It’s common for businesses to take a look at their competitors to see what
                                        strategies they have adopted and how they are performing. By evaluating the
                                        competitions, you’ll be gaining a deep understanding of the market trends, what
                                        they have in common, what’s going to work and what’s not going to work. It’s not
                                        like you are going to copy them, instead, you seek out inspiring designs,
                                        content, optimization, layout and even the strengths, weaknesses and
                                        opportunities to gain a strategic advantage in this field. By doing so, you are
                                        going to be the game-changer who can tell a story through your designs in a way
                                        that helps the audience see what you can provide better than your
                                        competitors.<br>

                                        Creating successful designs begins with identifying your target audiences and
                                        their needs. The more you can identify them, the deeper you can get an idea of
                                        what they want and then build designs catering to their requirements. Designing
                                        for your target audience will help you set clear goals and devise plans
                                        accordingly. Both patience and practice are important here, but once you’ve hit
                                        the jackpot, you’ll be confident to create winning strategies and enthralling
                                        designs that will leave your audience amazed.
