                                    <h3>1.Make Visitors Stay longer in the website</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Prospects walk into sales offices every day. The more number of potential
                                        customers, higher the chances of selling. The limitations of space limit the
                                        number of prospects you can entertain every day, in a virtual office such as a
                                        website. The possibilities are virtually unlimited. Businesses who do online
                                        marketing attract thousands of visitors into their websites and convert many of
                                        them into customers.

                                        At the end of the day, the money you spend to do each sale will affect your
                                        bottomline. The internet makes it possible to decrease your marketing expenses
                                        while increasing the sales. Isn't that wonderful ?</p>

                                    <h3>2.Engaging the Prospects Online</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Just like a smart sales person engages the prospect in any shop personally, your
                                        website needs to engage surfers browsing through your website. The time they
                                        spend in your website is an indicator of how well the website is engaging with
                                        the prospects.

                                        Bounce Rate

                                        Bounce rate is the measure of the number of people who leave your website before
                                        the first page gets loaded. It is the percentage of visitors who enter the site
                                        and then leave without continuing to view other pages within the same site.
                                        Bounce rates helps in finding out the effectiveness or performance of an entry
                                        page on generating interest to visitors in adhering to the site. Lesser bounce
                                        rate denotes better website, which can make visitors to cling on to the site.
                                        Factors affecting bounce rate are :



                                    </p>
                                    <div class="thumb">
                                        <a href="#"><img src="images/factors-1-830x1024.jpg" alt="Thumb"></a>
                                    </div>
                                    <h3>3.How well does your website listen to the visitors ?
                                        Empathise</h3>

                                    <p>

                                        We humans like to talk to people who are worthy of our attention. If a person
                                        talks about himself always, we are put off. Does he like to listen to you ?

                                        Websites are never as good as humans in empathizing with customer's
                                        requirement.
                                        Your website needs to learn from your sales people to do that. The more the
                                        website knows about the customer, better engaging it becomes.

                                        Customers are looking for something that meets their requirements and at the
                                        same time within their own spending capacity. Make it easy for him to make that
                                        decision with least effort.

                                        Answer the frequently asked questions without even being asked. Simplify the
                                        product offering using images videos and only limited text. Make it
                                        entertaining. Connect emotionally with the customer, help him to solve the
                                        problem the customer is trying to solve with your help.

                                        If properly implemented, your website can sell better than your best sales
                                        person. Even your best sales person gets tired at the end of the day. The
                                        website doesn't !

                                        How intuitive is your user experience ?

                                        The user experience of a site plays a vital role in sales. Make sure key
                                        elements of the website are catchy. Spend attention to positioning of images,
                                        buttons and text to make sure that they convey their purpose clearly.

                                        Be Context Sensitive

                                        When a user is visiting a particular page, try to give glimpses of the
                                        information he is likely to think of in the same page. Do not bury that
                                        information deep within menus.

                                        Proper use of anchor texts, improves readability. The anchor texts are the
                                        clickable text in hyperlink which enables navigation to other pages. Never let
                                        your clients get tangled inside your site with complex navigation design.


                                    </p>
                                    <h3> 4.Understand power of emotions</h3>

                                    <p>Emotions are the shortest path to trigger a successful business. Before that we
                                        need to figure out what appeals to our target audience to spend more time on our
                                        site. Try to put ourselves in customer's shoe and import their emotion as
                                        ours.
                                        Thus we should ensure our trust.

                                        Build Credibility from the beginning.

                                        Display your best work with pride. List out your top customer's in the home page
                                        itself. This gives the visitor a lot of confidence. Remember, most of the
                                        traffic at the home page may not make it to the remaining pages.

                                        Are you on the expensive side ? Explain Why

                                        Let us consider a visitor, who is looking for an affordable home. If the site
                                        says we only deal with luxury apartments, he will leave immediately. If the
                                        website does a good job of detailing the features we offer at the extra cost, he
                                        may change his mind.</p>

                                    <h3>5.Chat Interfaces and Inquiry Forms</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Chat Interfaces

                                        Chat windows bring in the human element. Make sure a qualified sales person
                                        answers the questions prospects have. When they are not able to address any
                                        queries, get the prospect's contact details and get back to them.

                                        It is very easy to convert a prospect who has decided to chat with you.

                                        Inquiry Forms  For god's sake ask contact number.

                                        It is very easy to enter phone number. Sometimes, easier than typing your own
                                        name.

                                        Enquiry forms should be easily accessible. These forms should have least number
                                        of mandatory fields. The information that you would like to have, but not
                                        required can move to a second non-mandatory form. If you know how to contact
                                        your customer, it is easier to call him up and get the remaining information.
                                    </p>
