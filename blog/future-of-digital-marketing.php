                                    <p>With a parallel virtual world around us, all it takes is one look at the
                                        tech-savvy generation and it is crystal clear that the future is in digital.
                                        This is where digital marketing comes to play as the marketing strategy of the
                                        future. As futuristic as it may seem, digital marketing has been around us for
                                        decades way before the advent of smartphones. That’s right, we are looking at an
                                        ocean of opportunities that revealed itself in front of us back in the days of
                                        Guglielmo Marconi- The man who engineered long-distance radio communication.

                                    <h3> What exactly is digital marketing?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Simply put, it is marketing via an electronic device. This definition clarifies
                                        the unbreakable connection of Marconi to this promising field. Getting the
                                        message out to people who needed services or products is the primary goal of any
                                        organization and marketing is what helps them do it. Taking advantage of the
                                        huge number of electronic communication devices used by humans, what better way
                                        is there to spread the message than displaying this message on the numerous
                                        screens men have their eyes on? This is what digital marketing is all about.
                                        Getting customers to see the product services offered by companies with or
                                        without them actually realising it.

                                        The evolution of Web 1.0 in the late eighties gave a new face to digital
                                        marketing it was in that period that the term itself was coined. Today with over
                                        one billion mobile phone users right at hand with ever-increasing numbers, the
                                        potential for digital marketing in India is skyrocketing. Tapping this potential
                                        gives rise to numerous career opportunities for enthusiasts and dream-come-true
                                        publicity for entrepreneurs.</p>
                                    <h3>

                                        What makes digital marketing popular?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Majority of the population has access to the internet which is the primary mode
                                        of digital advertising. With a greater number of mobile users, the impact radius
                                        of companies widens exponentially creating a larger customer base that
                                        translates into better sales. Digital marketing has lifted the demographic
                                        constraint that companies have been battling with over the decades. Customers in
                                        need, however far they are, receive advertisements for products offered by a
                                        certain company and can available services just by clicking on a few buttons. it
                                        makes the job of the client much easier and so does it benefit the
                                        organisations. Speaking of changing demographic barriers also means
                                        globalization of businesses. Otherwise unattainable levels of popularity and
                                        customers comes as a major advantage of digitalization.

                                        Digital marketing is economically business owners than traditional marketing
                                        where they have to deploy huge amounts of manpower which could barely cover a
                                        fraction of the customers that a company could possibly get. With online
                                        marketing strategies backed up by strong AI algorithms, institutions could
                                        directly target customers and send ads to them which ensures greater chances of
                                        the product being purchased.

                                        The support from the central government with its digital India initiative is
                                        promising in many ways as it helps take the internet to even the rural parts of
                                        the nation. This means that it isn’t just the metropolitan cities that are being
                                        targeted, but also the otherwise ignored rural India also comes into the
                                        perimeter.

                                        High rates of social media usage by young adults and teenagers makes it easy for
                                        organisations to target them with products of their liking. Facebook, Instagram,
                                        Twitter et cetera are platforms that are widely used by people and hence are
                                        ideal for setting the stage for a marketing revolution.</p>
                                    <h3>Future Of digital marketing in India</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The prospects of it becoming the number one career generator as well in the
                                        country is really high. With a growth rate of over 30% and climbing, the sector
                                        is booming and currently is worth billions. Quality experts in the field are of
                                        huge demand in the current scenario. It also opens a door of possibilities for
                                        freelance workers.

                                        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms are a vital part of
                                        effective online advertising that is personalized to each user. This means an
                                        increase in job opportunities for data scientists and programmers capable of
                                        filtering and processing information to send feeds that are exactly what they
                                        are looking for.

                                        The development of digital equipment in the nation’s rural areas has accounted
                                        for a massive increment in the number of people coming under the radar online
                                        marketing. Along with its population, the number of mobile phone users and
                                        social media users are climbing which further explicitly suggests that the
                                        future of online marketing in India is quite bright.

                                        worthy of customer time is a billion-dollar business opportunity without doubts.
                                        Looking the future in the eye, it is clear that the citizens henceforth are
                                        residents of a digital world which is why traditional marketing agencies are
                                        struggling to cope up. The expected turnover from digital marketing in a
                                        three-year span is more than double of what it is today.

                                        The number of digital marketing agencies in India is growing by leaps and bounds
                                        as the need to drive internet traffic to websites of companies is crucial to
                                        their survival. Predicting the future of digital marketing agencies doesn’t seem
                                        challenging anymore, owing to the statistical backup that supports a glorious
                                        time to come. Agencies will be more focussed on customer satisfaction in the
                                        digital realm, development of quality ML algorithms that are personalized to the
                                        core, extensive SMM techniques etc.

                                        Enhanced usage of chatbots and private messaging apps to connect the customer
                                        with the organisation is a key area of focus. Chatbot services are
                                        experimentally guaranteed to provide better customer satisfaction. Search Engine
                                        Optimization is taking a new face as Google introduces BERT- Bidirectional
                                        Encoder Representations from Transformers which is a sophisticated deep learning
                                        algorithm that processes natural human language. This is a field requiring
                                        greater attention as the ability of machines to process language has been a
                                        concern in recent years.

                                        The advent of digital assistants like Alexa, Siri etc is another shot that
                                        companies get on knowing their customers. Active voice searches that disclose
                                        the personality of the consumer is key to creating feeds that match their
                                        desires.

                                        We see companies better interested in a single software solution kind of
                                        approach. One tool that solves all issues is what the corporates are looking
                                        for. This essentially puts in demand the need to integrate various tools into a
                                        user-friendly environment that has a well encrypted back end that protects user
                                        privacy and prevents leakage of confidential data. This seems like a job for
                                        experts from a number of fields coming joining hands to attain a common goal.

                                        Digital marketing consultancies are sure to offer fat pay checks to the skilled
                                        workforce that form the backbone of the industry. Hence, looking for a job in
                                        the field will be lucrative in planning for the future.

                                        Arising from the fusion of words having contradicting meanings, the term
                                        glocalization is very significant in the Digital Marketing sphere which aims to
                                        bring together globalization and localization. As much as people prefer goods
                                        that are available globally, personalized or specifically catered services do
                                        have their advantages. To join these two factors is what giant corporations
                                        around the world are looking forward to achieving. Expand business around the
                                        globe- globalize and deliver to people like it’s made for them- localize- the
                                        perfect marketing strategy! There is no better alternative to achieve this goal
                                        than by pioneering in digital marketing, which is in no doubt – the future!</p>
