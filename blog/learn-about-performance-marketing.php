                                        for particular activities when they use performance marketing. When a viewer

                                    <br>
                                    <p>Performance marketing is a form of digital marketing in which firms only pay for
                                        campaigns
                                        depending on their results. Essentially performance marketing is when a business
                                        pays for its
                                        digital marketing efforts depending on each objective achieved or action taken.
                                        This might
                                        include anything from a click to a purchase, sign-up, or download.<br>
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>How Does Performance Marketing Work?</h2>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Performance marketing is fundamentally a two-sided process where one party
                                        controls an
                                        audience and the other (the marketer) seeks to reach that audience. Performance
                                        marketing
                                        involves the advertiser paying a platform or publisher such as Facebook to host
                                        their advertising
                                        campaigns in order to gain access to that audience.<br>
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Measurement Methods for Performance Marketing</h2>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Performance marketing focuses on assisting companies in ensuring that their
                                        marketing money
                                        is well spent, as they only pay when the intended goal is met. A performance
                                        marketer may
                                        utilize the following important measures to assess success which comprise of:

                                    <p>Advertisers place their commercials on a certain channel, and they are then paid

                                        how well the ad does. There are several different payment methods available for

                                    <h4>1. <b>Cost per click (CPC)</b></h4>
                                    <p>Advertisers pay for this measurement technique based on how frequently their ads
                                        are clicked.
                                        This strategy for boosting site traffic works well for performance marketing.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>2. <b>Cost per sale (CPS)</b></h4>
                                    <p>CPS only charges you when you make a sale spurred by advertising. This strategy
                                        is also
                                        commonly used in affiliate marketing.
                                    </p>

                                            your ad, you would
                                            pay your base rate x 1,000).</p>
