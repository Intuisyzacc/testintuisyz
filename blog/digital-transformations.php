                                    <h3>What Is Digital Transformation?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Digital transformation is simply adopting information technology to transform
                                        your business processes. The integral consideration of note is the application
                                        of the digital technology platforms & techniques to all elements in your
                                        business. It will bring a synchronous advantage to your operations, delivery,
                                        and value-addition for customers.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The working process of digital transformation is essentially a systematic method
                                        of defining your business goals in a new light. The initial step is to possess
                                        an understanding of your business's current situation. It will help you analyze
                                        the depth & clarity of required digital transformations, including the very
                                        need.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Ensure that all the parameters within your organization like leadership,
                                        technology, operations, work culture, and customer experience are a part of the
                                        transformation considerations. The next step is to create a strategic plan to
                                        achieve the transition in place, keeping the objectives & insights intact.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once you have a solid plan in its foundation, proceed with changing the status
                                        of your transformations in the up & running direction. You have to enable the
                                        investment channels for the appropriate personnel & skills to derive maximum
                                        value and returns.</p>
                                    <h3>Digital Transformation In Marketing & Sales</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Digital transformation contributes vastly to the marketing and sales segments,
                                        especially in the B2B sector. The buyer journey and the customer persona have
                                        evolved to a significant level of automation following online resource
                                        allocation. The primary perspective in adopting digital transformation in sales
                                        & marketing is to gather and deliver value relying on informative target
                                        content.</p>
                                    <p>The process is easier to explain by referring to the two scenarios below:</p>
                                    <h4><a href="https://intuisyz.com/blog/how-to-select-right-ecommerce-platform.php">ECommerce</a></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The scope of digital transformation extends to a broad array of platforms,
                                        devices, and digital assets. ECommerce is no exception. The best way to
                                        influence the concept in the eCommerce industry is by recognizing the role of
                                        customer expectations in the online realm. It enables your business to digitize
                                        numerous products & service offerings by engaging an optimum strategy of digital
                                        efficiency.</p>
                                    <h4>Sales Without ECommerce</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Future sales will arrive at a point of impossibility without eCommerce
                                        optimization. The sector needs to try to improve its strategy on the consumer
                                        front. The direct impact of digital transformation will hugely reflect on the
                                        retail section. Some of the default changes for your business in this category
                                        are the continuous disruption in API services, adoption of alternative payment
                                        methods, and implementation of innovative technology solutions.</p>
                                    <h3>Digital Transformation In Business Operations</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This section helps you determine the adequate contribution of digital
                                        transformation in various business operations with an onus on business
                                        information systems, management information systems, and enterprise resource
                                        planning.</p>
                                    <h4>BIS/MIS</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Business Information Systems & Management Information Systems are two top-tier
                                        techniques that find significance in digital transformation for any online
                                        business process. In BIS, business infrastructure and decision-making entities
                                        achieve maximum organizational potential. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        MIS is allocating the technology, personnel, and business processes in a
                                        synchronous mode to assist in information & productivity analysis plus critical
                                        decision-making for organizations. Both BIS & MIS are directly proportional to
                                        the digital transformation methodologies in your business environment.</p>
                                    <h4>ERP</h4>
                                    <p>ERP software and technology play an integral role in raising the bar of your
                                        digital transformation and its operation patterns. The various phases of your
                                        business that ERP can drive involve cleansing data, standardizing services,
                                        understanding the buyer journey, and working on actionable insights. All these
                                        elements add worth to your present digital transformation concerns.</p>
                                    <p>The top ERP modules contributing to the maximum efficiency & potential for your
                                        business are in the categories of accounting/finance, CRM, HR, inventory, and
                                        marketing management. ERP integrations in digital transformation help financial
                                        management by using factors like organizational agility, risk assessment,
                                        technology collaborations, and digital disruptions.</p>
                                    <p>Customer relationship management tools & resources gain sufficiently in the
                                        digital transformation phase. They help increase confidentiality, communication,
                                        and collaboration culture in your organization. The process of optimization is
                                        guiding the human resources department in multiple areas like onboarding,
                                        self-service portals, personnel analytics, tracking systems, chatbots, and
                                        digital adoption portals.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Digital transformation helps improve the effectiveness of different product
                                        types & goods within any business. It adds to the inventory management and
                                        optimization within your entity. Marketing automation functions take a positive
                                        stride by using digital transformation processes. It helps you strategize,
                                        optimize, commit, embrace, and seize marketing opportunities.</p>
                                    <h3>Impact Of Covid</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The recent pandemic has impacted multiple business sectors significantly.
                                        Covid's role in the digital transformation process is the constant acceleration
                                        of all the online business components. The pandemic gave rise to new trends in
                                        digital resources & a potential increase in establishing the fourth industrial
                                        revolution technologies.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In the initial phases of the pandemic, organizations across the world were
                                        off-guard, limiting their productivity. The idea and effectiveness of digital
                                        transformation changed the game in a favorable direction for businesses. The
                                        crisis allows a boost in the digitization of these businesses keeping the
                                        economy stable.</p>
                                    <p>Experts expect the post-pandemic era to continue with the constant evolution of
                                        digital transformation processes & will cause redefining of the entire concept
                                        consistently.</p>
                                    <h3>Digital Transformation & Automation/AI/Machine Learning</h3>
                                    <p>The term digital transformation and its influence on business activities will not
                                        be complete without discussing the application on various sub-niches. They
                                        include automation techniques, Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning
                                        (ML). </p>
                                    <p>Automation is the end-to-end technology that drives efficiency and transparency
                                        in business concepts. It helps organizations disregard the need for manual flow
                                        of operations. The keyword in creating optimal value for digital transformation
                                        is employing process automation steps in the organizational workflow. It is
                                        crucial not just for IT businesses but companies in numerous sectors &
                                        industries.</p>
                                    <p>AI is capable of providing an advanced take on standard automation tools. Your
