                                    <p>We know that a brochure is an informative document which appears to be in the
                                        form of a foldable card (usually in 3 fold format), used to introduce a company
                                        and its products/services. Basic and standard information like the firm’s name,
                                        contact details, logo & tagline, products & services, and benefits the firm can
                                        provide to their clients etc. are included in the brochures. Brochures are
                                        powerful advertising tools. They establish the identity of a business firm. Such
                                        documents can be used to advertise a company or a brand. In the earlier days,
                                        traditional printed brochures served as effective means of promotion, but today
                                        in this digital age, the companies which were using traditional brochures
                                        changed to electronic brochures.

                                    <p>
                                        Creating professional brochures does not require pro-level design skills.
                                        Content and engaging design are important in making a great impression of your
                                        products and services.

                                        Firstly, choose a format and template which you will be using for the entire
                                        brochure. You can search for the format and templates on the internet. Even the
                                        Microsoft word comes with a large number of templates for brochures. Adobe
                                        InDesign can be utilized for designing these documents. If you prefer, you can
                                        also develop a template from scratch, or else you can choose from the existing
                                        templates as mentioned earlier.

                                        After choosing a template, customize the templates by making necessary changes
                                        that suit your needs. Replace background, customize the font and add your own
                                        text and images. Remove or insert borders, text boxes and graphics. Make the
                                        design eye-catching to receive maximum attention. Use solid colours for the
                                        background. It is best advised to use only a single font or a maximum of 2
                                        different fonts for the entire content because using multiple fonts for
                                        different sections can result in a visually confusing design.

                                        Next step is adding the content. Delete the sample text and type in the text
                                        required in your e-brochure. Provide necessary headings for them. Write an
                                        engaging copy that will help in getting connected with the target audience.
                                        Arrange them with proper spacing and alignment. Along with the basic details of
                                        your company, you should also include content which defines how your
                                        organization is different from others and how the audience can get benefited by
                                        choosing your firm. Use descriptive headers, add subheadings, listings and
                                        bullet points. Use images, texts and links in the content.

                                        Once you are finished with the design and content, save it in pdf or any other
                                        format. Pdf will be the best format for distribution. The finished brochure can
                                        be uploaded on your website to ensure its online presence. You will be still
                                        able to edit and make changes in future. Make sure that the design is flawless
                                        with high-quality images and error-free texts. Once it is uploaded, you can
                                        share it through links and emails.</p>

                                        Printable Brochures Vs Online Brochures

                                        Today, many businesses opt for e-brochures rather than printable brochures. Both
                                        have their own advantages; however in this technological era, as everything is
                                        getting digitized, it is better to move along with that trend. The main
                                        advantages of e-brochures are cost efficiency and easiness of distribution.
                                        Online designing requires very little resources and effort. Businesses do not
                                        require to spend a large amount on printing and distribution of brochures. Also,
                                        these brochures are not bound by geographical boundaries; they have the
                                        potential to reach everywhere, globally.

                                        The global distribution of e-brochures can happen instantly. They can be sent to
                                        people who are living far away from you. You can refresh the content and make
                                        sure that you have the latest version of the document. The type of business is
                                        also an influential factor in choosing online brochures, for example: if the
                                        majority of your target audience is found to be on social media, then you can
                                        definitely go for e-brochures. The performance of the brochure could be easily
                                        tracked with the help of analytical tools, which is not possible in the case of
                                        printed brochures.

                                        The top ten advantages of e-brochures are provided below:
