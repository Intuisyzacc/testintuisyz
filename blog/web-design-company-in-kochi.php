                                    <p>



                                        Web design has undergone a speedy development within the last 20 years, that has
                                        been characterized by innumerable new design choices and technological advances.
                                        Web design trends lasted an extended time, however these days they barely have
                                        time to completely unfold.

                                        The following are a few examples of the newest web design trends you can expect
                                        from updated websites in 2017.



                                    </p>

                                    <h5>1. Use Established Layout Forms</h5>
                                    <p>

                                        
                                        One phenomenon has developed so quickly that several users already see it as an
                                        integral part of the menu representation: the little menu button, referred to as
                                        the ‘hamburger button’. Initially, it absolutely was in the main used for
                                        drop-down menus on mobile apps and mobile websites. Within the in the meantime,
                                        the sign has been used because the menu button on several desktop versions. It
                                        is identical to a layered hamburger and is illustrated using the mathematical
                                        symbol ‘≡’, which really means ‘identical’.

                                        The second, more recent web design trend affects how content is presented. Card
                                        layouts are being used more regularly. Here, text or ‘call to action’ buttons or
                                        image-based content are presented in many boxes that are distributed over the
                                        user interface.

                                        This provides many benefits : Additionally to the various ways in which it
                                        permits a website to be visually and clearly presented. Redistributing website
                                        content is very easy with a responsive web layout. The card layout became
                                        popular mainly through different web design platforms like Dribbble or image
                                        platforms like pinterest.

                                       

                                       

                                        

                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>  2. Interactive Storytelling</h5>
                                    <p>


                                       
                                        Unique content is the be-all-end-all for every website. But even the most
                                        reliable & credible websites want to represent their information in a way that
                                        prepare their content to emotionally draw in visitors. Storytelling is one of
                                        the visual and interactive design element. It is becoming a popular way for
                                        turning even the driest of topics into presentable, interesting content.
                                        Providing informative content ties visitors to a form of interactive
                                        presentation that grows the possibility of positive responses.

                                        Web design companies have become story tellers, just like traditional television
                                        advertisers. Consequently, web development services have transformed from a
                                        technology into an art form.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5> 3. Ideal Loading Times


                                    </h5>
                                    <p>

                                       
                                        The loading time of websites sometimes increases when incorporating elaborate
                                        graphics into websites. Therefore developers must be careful to evaluate which
                                        interactive content and multimedia provides the user an added value. Here “less
                                        is more” approach is best to follow.

                                        The same concepts apply to photos, videos and other forms of graphical media as
                                        they do to content. The content should be unique, relevant and valuable for the
                                        user and the content should only be loaded when the visitor accesses it.

                                     
                                        

                                    </p>
                                    <h5>   4. Infinite Scrolling</h5>
                                    <p>


                                     
                                        Infinite scrolling permits visitors to access new content easily by scrolling
                                        instead of clicking. When the end of a paragraph reached, the content of next
                                        page is automatically accessed. Social networks, like Facebook , have long since
                                        employed this procedure to represent their users with content that is as
                                        uncomplicated as possible. Infinite scrolling is a common tool used in blogs. It
                                        plays a large role in 2017 and beyond.

                                        It must be applied in some situations where the website operator doesn’t know
                                        which information is most relevant for the user. It also applies in the cases
                                        where various pieces of information are of same relevance for the reader. The
                                        following things must be followed when deciding to implement this scroll
                                        feature:

                                        Every sub page must have individual URL
                                        Reasonable loading time
                                        Overlapping content must be avoided
                                        Visitors must be able to simply locate the sought-for information

                                    </p>
                                    <h5>  5. Parallax Scrolling</h5>
                                    <p>



                                       
                                        Parallax scrolling method is a necessary building block for modern websites over
                                        the past few years. The ability to move different levels of a website at various
                                        speeds generates special visual effects. This effects are combined with elements
                                        that prompt the visitor to carry out a desired action. For this reason, parallax
                                        scrolling is an excellent feature to use in tandem with interactive
                                        storytelling.

                                        An additional web design trend that allows some websites to free themselves from
                                        the typical conventions of content. Illustrations allow designers to echo
                                        concepts found in a text in a way that is both easy to understand and
                                        complementary to the content’s main message. Texts with illustrations are hard
                                        for competitors to copy. Finding a professional graphic designer is well worth a
                                        thought for those who are unable to produce such illustrations themselves. The
                                        best example of using such illustrations is the homepage of the online storage
                                        service, Dropbox.

                                        The main problem of popular stock photos is implied in their very name : they
                                        are available to everyone. These photos can be found all over the web and do
                                        little to generate additional attention. For this reason, one of the important
                                        web design trends in 2017 is to use as many unique, high quality photos –
                                        especially for the website’s backgrounds.

                                        Many trends have developed in the web design world over the past few years. Most
                                        of these trends may not last long. In 2017 responsive design will continue to be
                                        of considerable relevance. In the future, web designers will aim to create using
                                        websites easier to access and even more user friendly.

                                        actions desired by the business. Web designing agencies in Kochi have already
                                        started adapting to this new trend.
