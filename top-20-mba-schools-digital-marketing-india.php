                                    <p>Digital marketing is growing at a very fast rate in India. The concept of digital
                                        advertising has been around for a few years. The strategies of marketing have
                                        experienced several changes with new digital marketing trends appearing each
                                        year. As technology keeps evolving, such trends are changing each and every day.
                                        With respect to these factors, a career in digital marketing would be a great
                                        choice. Digital marketing comprises many forms of marketing, and as it is a vast
                                        field, there is substantial demand for online marketers in a lot of companies
                                        across India and the rest of the world.

                                        Many educational institutions, startups and agencies are now providing courses
                                        with certification on digital marketing and its best-known strategies. Apart
                                        from that, some post-graduation courses like MBA started, including digital
                                        marketing in their syllabus. This is because learning a UG or PG course with an
                                        old and non-updated curriculum is of no use now, especially in this present
                                        technological age and as well as for the future. So, learning a new and updated
                                        course which is most relevant, along with management and administration studies
                                        would be a better option if you are opting a career in that field. Deep
                                        knowledge in digital marketing strategies provides you with more chances and
                                        opportunities for starting a business and making it a huge success. You could
                                        also become a business consultant and develop someone else’s business if you
                                        have acquired the necessary digital advertising skills. Or else, you could apply
                                        for positions like Digital Marketing Executive, Social Media Manager, Digital
                                        Marketing Strategist, SEO analyst, Social Media Marketer, Market research
