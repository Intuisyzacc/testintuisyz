                                    <p>Business leaders often forget that websites have a function to perform. Most of
                                        the time leaders focus on the aesthetics of the website, the colouring , images
                                        and the home page. Nothing is wrong in expecting your website to look good, in
                                        fact websites affect your brand image more than ever today.<br>

                                        If you expect your website to help you in generating business, your approach
                                        needs to change. Digital marketing companies have a mandate of generating
                                        enquiries or sales at the lowest possible cost. There is no doubt that an awful
                                        looking website will drive away traffic and business, but an excellent looking
                                        website doesn’t guarantee increased business unless it follows certain
                                        rules.<br>

                                        Web design is one of the most sought after services of the digital age simply
                                        because the market is huge. There are millions of websites in the internet, this
                                        gives jobs to millions of web designers too. Problem is that only a fraction of
                                        these web designers have the skills to generate business for you. This is
                                        because web design is a technical skill, marketing is more of a business skill,
                                        add to that the artistic skills he needs to make it look good, Now you can see
                                        the logic behind why a good web designer is a lot rarer than most people can
                                        fathom.<br>

                                        Know your customer
                                        <br>
                                        A good web designer needs to design for your potential customers only. If your
                                        potential customer doesn’t appreciate good appearances, your website simply
                                        doesn’t need to look good. Customers’ taste differs widely based on their
                                        culture, personality, financial habits and several other factors. If you are a
                                        busy individual, your browsing habits will be very different from a leisurely
                                        gentleman. If you are busy, you want to get straight to the point. If you are
                                        good in marketing, you know that most people who can pay high prices are very
                                        very busy. That is why your web designer needs to get to the point very
                                        quickly.<br>

                                        There are several aspects he needs to consider such as coloring , font size, use
                                        of animations, images etc depending on the demographics of your customer base.
                                        For examples, elderly customers need enhanced readability, most businessmen
                                        prefer conservative coloring, the younger generation is far less patient and
                                        prefers brighter colors, Men and women have different browsing habits, the list
                                        goes on and on. The user interface will have to adapt to the business the
                                        website represents. An entertainment business can have a colorful and playful
                                        website. A construction company mostly prefers blue or grey color tones.<br>

                                        The Indian weakness<br>

                                        Web designers in kerala often succumb to the the subcontinent’s cultural
                                        weaknesses. For instance, we have a habit of elaborating first and summarising
                                        later or never. If you need to capture someone’s attention, you need to first
                                        summarise and only later elaborate. This helps the listener to decide whether he
                                        wants to pay attention.<br>

                                        As the saying goes, Images are far more powerful than a 100 words in
                                        communicating. Human brains can intuitively connect to images, it struggles to
                                        read through even simple text if it runs into paragraphs. Use of animations
                                        saves a lot of time as it conveys many pictures in a few seconds. Use of
                                        animations and images if done appropriately can improve the effectiveness of
                                        your website at least 10 times. Recent research has concluded that attention
                                        span of an average web surfer has reduced from 8 seconds to 4 seconds in just
                                        two years. As a consequence, web designers have to get better and better at
                                        conveying your sales pitch at the least number of seconds.<br>

                                        What is your story ?<br>

                                        Think of yourself as a storyteller. You need to tell people your story, this
                                        helps them connect to you much better. Why do you exist ? Will the user connect
                                        to you emotionally ? If you have never thought about these aspects of your
                                        website, it is quite possible that your website will fail to engage with your
                                        customers.The best web designers are great storytellers. They use timing
                                        suspense and mystery to a great advantage.<br>

                                        Do not forget that you are trying to sell something. When somebody wants to
                                        invest his time or money on your product or service you have to be reassuring.
                                        Be forthcoming when it comes to your terms and conditions. Make it easy for the
                                        customer to find out whether your pricing will suit him. Digital businesses have
                                        revolutionised price negotiations to the extent that the best web services are
                                        free. The good business is so transparent that the display their pricing in
                                        their homepage. But let’s be practical not every business can publish their
                                        pricing in the website. In such cases reduce the effort it takes for the
                                        potential customer find out your pricing. Providing chat support adds the human
                                        touch to your website, if your customer support person has the necessary skills,
                                        browsing your website can become a truly pleasant experience for the customer.
                                        <br>
                                        Building credibility is very critical in sales. Customer needs to trust your
                                        business with his money and reputation. There are several ways to gain trust. Do
                                        you have an awesome portfolio? Flaunt it. Use influencers, Do you have celebrity
                                        customers will they provide testimonials to you. When famous people vouch for
                                        you your credibility increases tremendously.<br>

                                        The difficult salesman<br>

                                        The great tragedy of web design is that is that very often, a customer is
                                        convinced with your sales pitch, but struggles to make a purchase. He believes
                                        you, He is willing to pay your price but he doesn’t know how to buy from you. Do
                                        you have contact details using which which they can contact you. Do you
                                        international customers spend a lot of money to call your number can you afford
                                        at toll-free number. Do you promised a call back if the register their phone
                                        number in your website. Is it possible to pay online and get the products or
                                        services. Do you have a refund policy? The more difficulty you create for your
                                        purchasers, lesser will be your sales.<br>

                                        Now that you have an awesome website your cash register should start when you
                                        write start ringing right? Wrong! Even the greatest website cannot generate
                                        sales unless relevant traffic is directed to the website.Professional digital
                                        marketing companies can help you bring traffic into your website. There are
                                        several techniques employed by digital marketers to bring in traffic. You can
                                        use Search Engine Optimisation, Search Engine Marketing, Social Media
                                        Advertising , Social Media Optimisation or Content Marketing.This is not an
                                        exhaustive list of techniques, but the most popular and effective ones. Search
                                        engine optimisation is a very effective technique to bring in quality traffic.
                                        The problem with this technique is that it takes some time to generate results.
                                        For immediate results you may use advertising techniques in search engine social
                                        media or other Internet service providers. You need to be very careful before
                                        you pay anything to a so-called Internet advertiser. if you have a credit card
                                        you can easily place advertisement on most of the leading Internet service
                                        providers all by yourself. Problem with advertising yourself is that you need to
                                        learn about digital marketing before starting.It is difficult to target your
                                        potential customers even with the best Internet advertising services as
                                        advertising to the wrong customer base will surely bring new traffic but it will
                                        not necessarily bring in customers.<br>

                                        Are we there yet ?

                                        Once you have started advertising you need to start measuring whether your
                                        efforts are in the right direction. You may use traffic analytic services to
                                        measure , adjust and improve the performance of your advertisements. If you are
                                        advertising to the right customers, they are likely to stay in your website
                                        longer. Higher bounce rates and lower time spent are sure indicators that you
                                        are going in the wrong direction.<br>

                                        Ultimately, the real test of your digital marketing campaign is the number of
                                        sales you generate and the cost you incur to bring in these sales. If you are
                                        able to sell at a lower cost compared to your existing channels, congratulations
