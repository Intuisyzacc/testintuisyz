                In 2019, a young startup in California, US, approached us to help them build a web and mobile
                application that can support underprivileged students in the US. The application is developed to guide
                the students to choose their graduate programs, primarily in government-run community colleges.The
                primary motive of the web and mobile application of the US-based startup is to help the students to
                avoid the pitfalls of Choice Based Credit System in the US. The application can guide a student to
                choose the right graduate program in accordance with his or her aptitudes and interests. It can also
                help them to find out their real academic requirements and guide them to adapt to their chosen graduate
                program.

            <h3 class="sub-heading"> Solution</h3>
            <p>
                In an IT outsourcing project, a closer collaboration between the offshore and onshore companies can lead
                to greater success of the project. A combination of our decade long IT business experience and their
                clear-cut vision and mission turned the IT outsourcing project into a win-win affair for both
                companies.Our primary objective was to minimize the wastage of cost of the startup project.Creating
                low-cost prototypes is one of the ways we cut down the project costs. In an exponentially evolving
                technological scenario, we have quickly adapted to the ever-changing conditions to date. We have offered
                our guidance in solving the glitches in their business operations that most companies face in their
                startup stage.These are the major ways we overcame the challenges during the IT outsourcing project.
                We built the prototype in core PHP and JavaScript on a Linux server, ensuring a faster and cheaper
                project development.
                Only 10% of the features in the first monolithic prototype were finalized for the MVP built on ReactJS
                and Java Springboot on AWS.
                Implemented CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline architecture to accelerate
                application development.
                Implemented Agile Model and enabled automated testing.</p>

            <p>
                The case study sheds light on the significant role of a professional IT consultation service at a
                business organization’s creative yet technical side in its digital transformation phase.

                Our IT outsourcing project is an ongoing one that provides us with hands-on experience in futuristic
                bleeding edge technologies in mobile and web application development. The project is a great learning
                experience for both the companies involved in the project.
