                    <p>
                        During 2014-2015, Search Engine Marketing was in its infancy, and the competition for Kalyan
                        Developers was very low, with only four competitors. So the Search Engine Marketing incurred
                        only one-fourth of the cost it demands today. In 2020, the number of competitors for the company
                        increased to 20. The cost optimised search engine marketing strategy made Kalyan Developers
                        noticeable in the digital world and enabled them to attract the target audience’s attention at a
                        lower cost. The optimisation of the website of the Kalyan Developers enhances its
                        user-friendliness and easy navigation to generate genuine online enquiries. At every stage of
                        the advertising campaign, we maintained a strict budget to make sure every single penny is being
                        rightly spent on the right advertising platforms targeting the right customers.</p>

                        We maintained a collaborative approach throughout the digital marketing campaign. It involves
                        ongoing consultation with the top-level officials to make them aware of the digital marketing
                        strategies involved and bring more sales to the business. The consulting process was very
                        precise in that they could lay out the exact online marketing cost incurred for the sale of
                        single real estate property of the company. The accurate data- driven cost analysis helped the
                        company to sell each of their real estate properties profitably.</p>

                    <p>
                        This strategy aims to identify the customer intent before it has been introduced to the online
                        traffic and filter the online advertisements in accordance with it. Enhancement in Click-Through
                        Rates (CTR) helps to reduce the cost-per-click (CPC) and optimised the online marketing
                        campaign.</p>

                        The careful identification and elimination of negative keywords or negative matches from the
                        online searches helped to bring down the cost per click and, thus, to maintain a healthy budget
                        for digital advertising. It also helped to generate quality online enquiries. Extensive open
                        discussions and follow-ups of the enquiry handling team ultimately converted the online leads
                        into new clients of Kalyan Developers.</p>

                    <p>
                        Implementation of the Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) strategy helped Kalyan Developers to
                        gain greater online visibility. The introduction of ‘a call to action’ option in the website
                        boosted the frequency of genuine online enquiries. The chat script used in the online chat box
                        was manually updated to create an engaging user experience. It, in turn, helped to convert more
                        online enquiries to sales. By analysing customer behaviour patterns, further developments were
                        made in the CRO strategy to bring the consistency that defines the overall success of the
                        digital marketing campaign.</p>

                        accomplish digital transformation in marketing. Kalyan Developers, a company, once relied
                        heavily on non-digital mediums for advertising, witness, 90% of their business comes from
                        digital platforms today. It also prompted Kalyan Developers to bestow the digital marketing
