                                        Web design companies very often focus too much on the user experience, they

                                        Search Engine Optimization or SEO is the process used to improve traffic to a
                                        website by getting a high-rank placement within the Search Engine Results Page
                                        like Google, Yahoo, Bing, Yandex etc. SEO has two techniques, they are On Page

                                    <h3> On Page SEO</h3>
                                    <p>

                                        linking etc. It is the practice of optimizing our website (both the content and
                                        HTML source code of a page that can be optimized) in order to rank higher and
                                        get relevant traffic in search engines. Overall the on-page technique refers

                                    <p>Off page SEO is an important part of search engine optimization. It is the
                                        method to market your websites in search engines by performing some activities

                                        visibility. Using the on-page SEO techniques, we are able to get visibility in
                                        search engines. Off-page techniques are used to improve the website’s position
                                        in search engine result pages. Back linking is the most popular off page SEO
                                        method. To build quality back links from different high domain authority
                                        websites, bookmark your web pages in social bookmarking sites and share content
                                        in social media sites</p>

                                        People in the future never walk around with desktops. Because it is difficult.
                                        Now people move to mobile devices for all their internet purposes. Many even use
                                        it at home. A lot don’t even own laptops. If you start working on a website, to
                                        make sure that it is mobile friendly or custom-made for it. It is better to go
                                        with responsive website instead of making a special website for mobiles.
                                        Responsive web design will be a better option.

                                        Some movies do little to limit our imagination of future technologies. Having
                                        the ability to talk to machines and having them work for us was among the

                                        Not everyone has high speed internet access. There are many complaints about
                                        slow internet speed, if your site has to load slowly and take its own time
                                        through the tough hustle in the lives of the users. Don’t even bother optimizing
                                        your sites. Without speed, there is nothing. Optimize the formats and responsive
                                        sizes of the media that you have uploaded onto your website and eliminate loose
                                        links and pointless data that slows down loading time.

                                        Majority of target audiences are browsing internet through their smartphones. So
                                        make your website mobile friendly. In April 21, 2015 google introduced an
                                        algorithm, that the mobile friendly sites will be given higher priority and rank
                                        them better in search results. They have given clear guidelines about how to
                                        make a mobile friendly website. Google provides a mobile friendly test tool, it
                                        is used to see if pages on your website are mobile-friendly or not.

                                        Professional SEO companies never limit to their knowledge to just optimizing,
                                        they create high quality content as well. Search engines are using machine
                                        learning to separate blogs written by search engine companies to fool the
                                        machines from high quality content aimed at humans. Soon, sites will get
                                        punished for writing bogus content to fool search robots. Only way to beat the
                                        robots is with creativity and ingenuity. Do proper research, and write
                                        entertaining content. The more engaging your blog is, more likely they will help
                                        your search engine rankings. Keep posting articles that you have written with
                                        passion for the subject and that will help others.

                                    <p>


                                        The new website may or may not have facebook and other social media accounts.
                                        Almost everyone have at least 2 social media accounts. A single post showing up
                                        on someone’s timeline can interest the user to click it. They click, comment,
                                        share, re-post, contribute, etc. Don’t miss social media, it is the doorstep of
                                        the internet users.

                                        One easy trick to find out if a company gives good service is to see whether
                                        they have repeated customers. Customers generally become addicted to good
                                        service provided, once they are happy with a vendor, they prefer not to leave
                                        them.

                                        Link building refers to the process of getting external pages to link to a page
                                        on your website. It is one of the main off page technique used in search engine
                                        optimization. Try to generate better links with proper keywords.

                                    <p>





                                        Long tail keywords are those three and four keywords that are more specific to
                                        your product or service. Usually long tail keywords have higher conversion rate
                                        and less search traffic. Also long tail keywords have less competition. The
                                        longer the keyword, lesser is the competition. If you identify that niche long
                                        tail keyword your customers often search for before your competitor, you are in
                                        for a treat!
