                                Sijin Stephen is the Founder and Director of Intuisyz Information Technology and Social
                                Media Consulting and a visionary with acute business acumen. Sijin has fostered the
                                company from its very inception and its recognition today can be attributed to his
                                insight and integrity. Fascinated by technology at the tender age of 13, he brilliantly
                                demonstrated his erudition by developing his own versions of popular computer games.

                                After graduation, he went on to work with a multitude of corporates based in India and
                                abroad, a journey that greatly supplemented his knowledge and expertise in understanding
                                global trends. Being an entrepreneur of utmost calibre, he currently leads three
                                companies with unfeigned passion and commitment. His cordial nature coupled with
                                extraordinary determination and keenness of perception makes him stand out from any
                                crowd. Young and dynamic, Sijin has proved that dedication, innovation and commitment
                                can do wonders to the success of any enterprise.

                            Under his leadership, Intuisyz pioneered the social media marketing in South India and
                                led campaigns for a number of renowned personas and enterprises, which in turn played an
                                instrumental role in its own rise to acclaim. Currently, Intuisyz is a trusted name in
                                web designing and internet marketing, an achievement that is a reflection of his
                                excellence and foresight. Sijin has proved that leadership is not about wielding power,
                                but about empowering others with nobility and humility. He has converted many a dreams
                                to realities, and continues to inspire the Intuisyz family with his innate spark to
                                innovate.</p>
