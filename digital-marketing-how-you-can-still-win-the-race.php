                                        Digital marketing has seen a significant surge in the recent years. Unlike the
                                        old days, it is no longer wise to avoid the scope of internet marketing. Various
                                        famous brands who had ruled out internet marketing are today spending a fortune
                                        to secure a position in the online platform.

                                        In this increasingly competitive backdrop, how do you effectively market your
                                        product to the right audience?

                                        Apart from the costly SEOs, what other alternatives do you have to boost your
                                        business on the internet? To answer that, we might have to take a better look at
                                        marketing as a whole.

                                        The primary aim of all marketing techniques is to garner attention.

                                        This is because attention of your customers is a wonderful thing to have – it
                                        doesn’t usually matter how you gain it as long as you know to manipulate it to
                                        create a good impression in their minds. As much as attention is important, it
                                        equally matters whose attention you are seeking.<br><br>
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="thumb">
                                        <a href="#"><img src="images/3-768x472.jpg" alt="Thumb"></a><br>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>When it comes to effective marketing, target audiences do matter.</p>
                                    <div class="thumb">
                                        <a href="#"><img src="images/2-768x380.jpg" alt="Thumb"></a>
                                    </div>
                                    <br>

                                    <p> Factors like affordability of the customers play an important role in
                                        determining whether it is beneficial for you to spend your resources to reach
                                        out to pools of specific pools of customers who are unlikely to convert.
                                        Choosing where to market is as important as choosing the right means to market.
                                        This is exactly where the magic of SEO lies, as it markets you right in front of
                                        the needy customers.

                                        Your chances of converting visitors to customers are high when you get
                                        introduced to people who have been looking up for the services you offer. But as
                                        every rose has it thorns, SEO happens to be time consuming and quite expensive
                                        for a majority of us to afford and employ.

                                        So, are there any alternatives that are equally effective but less expensive?

                                        Fortunately, we do have other options that enable us to spot the needy customers
                                        and attract their traffic. This can be done through search based ads, content
                                        sensitive ads, facebook ads, etc, and can be of equal help as SEO, if you know
                                        how to use them. To begin with, going creative on Facebook and winning hearts
                                        with likes is one way to impress your potential customers and to win them on
                                        your side. This has far reaching advantages, as once you have their approval,
                                        your customers will start reaching out to you on your fb pages, email ids,
                                        phones, chat windows, etc to make enquiries.

                                        This digital communication is practically akin to that happens in the real
                                        space, and often results in purchases. Facebook can be a major catalyst to your
                                        success story this way. But again, no path to success comes free of hurdles.
                                        Digital advertising alone cannot get you to the top. Imagine that you open up a
                                        flower shop, which is inaugurated by Angelina Jolie. The hype and publicity
                                        following this might drive in innumerable customers whose attention you have
                                        captured. But suppose that you take it for granted and do not focus on anything
                                        else. As what people ultimately want is quality, would the initial publicity
                                        really be of help later? The same applies to the digital world.

                                        Your advertising might have won their attention, but that does not mean success
                                        is for granted.</p>
                                    <div class="thumb">
                                        <a href="#"><img src="images/4-768x432.jpg" alt="Thumb"></a>
                                    </div>

                                    <p>Factors like an ill-managed website would disappoint the customers who follow the
                                        leads, and you might be losing customers whom you could have actually had if due
                                        care was taken.The point is, when you spend a lot on advertising, try to make it
                                        worth it. Also, there is an important question which many might forget to ask
                                        themselves at this stage – how do I measure the effective is the marketing
                                        strategy chosen?</p>
                                    <div class="thumb">
                                        <a href="#"><img src="images/5-768x486.jpg" alt="Thumb"></a>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>How do you budget for internet advertisements ?</p><br><br>
                                    <div class="thumb">
                                        <a href="#"><img src="images/Croped00-581x1024.jpg" style="width:100%"
                                                alt="Thumb"></a>
                                        <p>This can be done by estimating the amount of money you spend on each enquiry.
                                            The lower it is, the better the marketing. But how do you estimate the sum
                                            spent per enquiry? To begin with, not all sources of marketing cost you the
                                            same. When you attract customers from various sources, both online and
                                            offline, it costs you different sums depending upon where you chose to
                                            advertise. Imagine that a realtor wants to sell a flat worth 1 crore, and
                                            spends 1 lakh on advertising the same. Suppose that he gets 100 enquiries,
                                            and that the sale is set. Now, how do we calculate the money spent by this
                                            realtor per each enquiry? As the number of enquiries here is 100, his
                                            advertising expense for the sale is 100 times the amount of money spent on
                                            generating each enquiry. So, in this case, he spent Rs. 1000 per enquiry.
                                            Now imagine the same company employing a different method and achieving a
                                            sale on every Rs 20000. This is lesser than the first case, and much more
                                            profitable. Therefore, it is important for businesses to try all available
                                            means of advertising to see which works best for them.

                                            Once you answer these questions, you can calculate how much organic traffic
                                            can you channel in a fixed time and then start framing your own marketing
                                            strategy instead of SEOs. A well planned marketing strategy almost always
                                            pays you back. So seize your moment now and reach out to your customers on
                                            Facebook and Google, because if you won’t, your competitors will.</p>
