            <h3 class="sub-heading"> Introduction</h3>
            <p>


                The 35-year-old Thaliyan Group is the parent company of Thaliyan Traders and Grand Master Cattle Feeds.
                Thaliyan Traders, one of the leading names in the Indian animal health industry, operates as a supplier
                of first-class animal feeds, animal feed supplements, dairy products, and high-quality rice for more
                than a decade. Grand Master Cattle Feeds is a manufacturer of feed ingredients, feed formulations,
                compound feed, premixes, feed additives and customised fodder solutions.
                In 2013, Thaliyan Group approached INTUISYZ to design a brochure and logo for their offline marketing
                purposes. The cordial relationship that blossomed since the logo and brochure design led to the design
                of the websites for Thaliyan Group, Thaliyan Traders and Grand Master Global in later years.

            <h3 class="sub-heading"> Analysis and Capitalisation on Current Macro Indian Digital Scenario</h3>
            <p>


                Since 2015, the digital scenario of India has been greatly transformed with the advent of low-priced
                smartphones, affordable data charges, and increased usage of digital devices like laptops and tablets
                among commoners.
                We launched the Facebook pages for Thaliyan Traders and Grand Master Cattle Feeds as digital platforms
                for advertising campaigns. Moreover, to test the waters for further digital promotional activities of
                the companies. As a result, the digital marketing campaigns through Facebook gained popularity and met
                with great success within a shorter period. It motivated us to launch a video advertisement campaign for
                Grand Master Cattle Feeds in February 2020, three months before the Corona pandemic. While the whole
                world stood still owing to the pandemic and the lockdown measures imposed by the government, the video
                advertisement campaign went viral in the digital world.
                During the tumultuous pandemic days, the grand success of the video advertisement campaign along with
                the ease of lockdown restrictions on fodder transportation by the state government boosted the sales and
                revenue of Grand Master Cattle Feeds. It has also firmly placed the brand as one of the top cattle feed
                manufacturers in Kerala to take measures to augment its production capacity to meet the increasing
                demand.

            <h3 class="sub-heading"> Implementation of ERP Suite</h3>
            <p>

                Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a type of software system that aids the management of the
                day-to-day business activities of a company, such as accounting, project management, risk management and
                supply chain operations. A full-fledged ERP suite can also manage enterprise performance by offering
                support to plan, budget, forecast, and report on a company's financial results. In addition, efficient
                ERP systems ease data flow among various business processes that eliminate data duplication and provide
                data integrity.
                Grand Master Cattle Feeds, realizing the potential of digital marketing and the dire need for the
                digital transformation of their enterprise, bestowed the task of implementing the ERP suite for their
                company on INTUISYZ.
                Intuisyz began with the development of the sales management software system for Grand Master Cattle
                Feeds.</p>
